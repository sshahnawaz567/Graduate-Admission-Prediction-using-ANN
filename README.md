# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN
Graduate Admission Prediction Using ANN
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict graduate school admissions based on various academic features. The model utilizes the Keras library with dense layers, ReLU activation functions, and the Adam optimizer for training. The dataset is preprocessed using NumPy and Pandas, and visualized with Matplotlib to analyze trends and performance.

Key Features:

Model Architecture: A fully connected neural network with dense layers and ReLU activation.
Optimization: Adam optimizer for efficient training and convergence.
Data Handling: Use of NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation.
Visualization: Matplotlib for visualizing training performance and evaluation metrics.
This project showcases the application of neural networks in educational data analysis, providing insights into factors influencing graduate admission decisions.
